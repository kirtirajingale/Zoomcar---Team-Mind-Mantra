    <p class="para">In addition to being the capital city, Delhi is a cosmopolitan city with
         people from all over the country, and ready to embrace an evolving lifestyle. 
         Surrounded by the 4 states of Haryana, Rajasthan, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh, 
         Delhi has a mixed culture and a vibrant social life. 
      With an expanding road length of over 25,000 kilometres (including national highways), 
     there has been a steady rise in the self drive car rental in Delhi that are more affordable
     than chauffeur-driven vehicles and offers on-road convenience to young drivers and working professionals.</p>

Zoomcar provides you with the joy of driving a car, without any of the added responsibilities involved in owning a car such as filling up petrol, 
        getting your car serviced, or paying for car insurance. It also ensures safety (especially for young women) while travelling in a group or individually.
